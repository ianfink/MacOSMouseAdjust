MacOSMouseAdjust includes a shell script and two AppleScripts that can be useful in
switching mouse speeds from the command line.  For example, when using one mouse at
home and a second, different, mouse at work, MacOS may respond differently.  Rather
than battling a mouse that is too “fast,” the speed can be adjusted to a default for
that mouse from the command line.  The shell script is run from the command line,
and based on an argument provided to the shell script, an AppleScript is executed
and adjusts the mouse speed by accessing the System Preferences and adjusting the
mouse speed there.  Although adjusting two mouse speeds are implemented, additional
adjustment of mouse speeds can be implemented.
